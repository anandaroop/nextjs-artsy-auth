A proof-of-concept Next.js app that can:

- Authenticate with Gravity and create a user session
- Support two-factor authentication
- Support Vercel's [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app) for data fetching with caching, deduping, revalidating etc
- Provide custom hooks (useGravity, useMetaphysics) to further simplify data fetching from Artsy sources
- Render some sample pages using data from Gravity and Metaphysics
